# X-Bank

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka (for asynchronous messaging between microservices)
- **Communication**: gRPC (for synchronous request and response between services)
- **Authentication**: Hydra (for JWT management)

## Technologies Used

### Go (Golang)
The main programming language used for developing the application. Go is known for its simplicity, performance, and strong support for concurrent programming.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing relational data. It provides a robust and scalable solution for handling structured data.

### Redis
Redis is used as an in-memory data store, often used for caching, session management, or handling high-throughput operations that need low-latency responses.

### Apache Kafka
Kafka is used for asynchronous communication between microservices. It allows decoupling of services and ensures reliability and scalability in message delivery.

### gRPC
gRPC is used for communication between services in a synchronous manner. It enables fast, efficient, and low-latency communication using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.

### Hydra
Hydra is used for managing JWT tokens for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access control between services in the application.
