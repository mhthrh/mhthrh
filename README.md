# X-bank project

This project is currently **under production** and is built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL and Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka (for asynchronous messaging between microservices)
- **Communication**: gRPC (for synchronous request and response between services)
- **Authentication**: Hydra (for JWT management)
- **End User Communication**: HTTPS REST (for communication with end users)

## Microservices Architecture

- **Microservices**: The application is designed using a microservices architecture, where each service is independent, has its own database, and can communicate asynchronously via Kafka and synchronously via gRPC.
- **API Management**: An API management layer is used to expose APIs securely to end users through HTTPS REST. This layer ensures easy access to services and handles routing, load balancing, and API versioning.
- **Independent Databases**: Each microservice has its own independent database (PostgreSQL), which ensures better isolation, scalability, and flexibility.
